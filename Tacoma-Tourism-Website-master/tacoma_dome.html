	<p class="text-information">The Tacoma Dome is one of the largest wood domed structures in the world. It is owned and operated by the City of Tacomaâ€™s Venues & Events Department. Flexibility is the key to the success of the Tacoma Dome. With new state of the art telescopic seating and an extensive curtaining system, almost any event is possible. The unique configurations mean the Tacoma Dome can accommodate 1,000 to 21,000 patrons, making it the largest indoor venue in the state of Washington.</p>

    <p class="text-information">On July 1, 1981 the Tacoma Dome started construction with the aspirations to be a "facility that has the greatest flexibility of any structure of its kind in the world". It took 19.5 months to complete construction of the 152 foot tall and 530 foot staple of the Tacoma area. It was a massive effort that took over 320,000 nails and 260,000 square feet of concrete to form such a enourmous yet sturdy structure that has come to be one of the defining landmarks of the city.
